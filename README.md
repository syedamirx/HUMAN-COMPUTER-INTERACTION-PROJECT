## Domain Description ##
From wildlife experts to wildlife hobbyists, anyone exploring nature will eventually run across an animal or plant they can’t identify. Currently, there are multiple ways to identify unknown wildlife and plants including books, websites, expert advice, and mobile applications. However, for someone looking to quickly identify an animal or plant, their choices are limited. Mobile applications that exist for wildlife identification and tagging are targeted at people with advanced knowledge about nature and intended to be used under no time constraints. Being directed at expert audiences, the layout requires some level of expertise to use. In this mobile
interaction project, we developed a proof of concept for an application called WildSnap that allows users to identify and tag wildlife and plants using pictures taken from within the app while providing a social media aspect. This application expands from existing applications to include fast interactions, a wider audience, and gamification to promote the retention of users. This application will provide insight into HCI issues such as mobile application design for timeconstrained interactions as well as user interfaces that encourage retention within the app. 
## Tasks Performed ##
Below following 10 tasks uses good hci and users can also performs in these domain.

1. User Friendly Interface:
These mobile application is unique in that it will provide auto-detection using an image search, allow quick picture taking, provide a non-technical user-friendly interface, and promote retention through the use of gamification techniques

2. Intended For All Audiences:
The application is intended for all audiences and could be used by nature groups and clubs, classrooms, or casual users to engage people in friendly competition while educating them about nature.

3. Enviourmental:
The application is intended to be used in any situation in which the user may wish to identify an animal or plant including indoors or while hiking.

4. Gain Points And Earn Achievements:
Users will be able to gain points and earn achievements that improve the status of their profile by posting and tagging their photos.

5. Available For Both Wildlife And Plant Life:
This application will also be available for both wildlife and plant life rather than limiting the user to only be able to research a specific type of animal, environment, location, etc

6. keystroke-level model:
 Use the Keystroke-Level Model to represent aspecific task for our system. We chose to use the keystroke-level model (KLM) because it is helpful for tracking user actions to estimate the efficiency of design by completing a given task by breaking it down into subtasks based on human input and system response within the application

7. Gain Points And Earn Achievements:
Users will be able to gain points and earn achievements that improve the status of their profile by posting and tagging their photos.

8. Connect Users With Their Friends and Followers:
 The homepage will connect users with their friends and followers within the app and notify them of new photos those users have updated and identified.

9. Connect Users To Social Media Platfor:
These application also connect on a social media platform you can easily share your take picture on social media accounts.

10. Fast Interactions For Users:
we’ve designed the application to provide fast interactions for users who will want to document observations on the spot.

## Prospect Technology Use ##

To analyze our product, we decided to use the Keystroke-Level Model to represent a specific task for our system. We chose to use the keystroke-level model (KLM) because it is helpful for tracking user actions to estimate the efficiency of design by completing a given task by breaking it down into subtasks based on human input and system response within the application. The KLM is also composed of six operators to represent the user’s physical motor actions such as keystrokes (K), pointing with the mouse (P), homing hands to the keyboard (H), and drawing line segments (D), cognitive mental actions from the user’s perspective (M), and an operator that takes into account the response from the system itself (R). For our study we had to modify several of the operators for computing a task on a mobile device rather than a computer system, for instance the keystrokes were counted as number of taps on the phone screen, pointing with the mouse would be moving your finger to point to the desired area of the app, and we assumed that the user’s hands would always be homed on the mobile device.
