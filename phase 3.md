## Need Finding ##
- All the designs and the thoughts gathered together and now we are heading towards our final design and we are going to implement it in our application.

# Design Alternative #

### Design Alternative 1 ###
- At initial we want a simple static design layout for our application to make user understand each and every option easily adn we thought to have simple color combinations that looks very decent.
  
### Design Alternative 2 ###
- After that we found our first design not that much attractive so we decided to remove static pictures and add slider so that it gives more attraction to the application.
  
### Design Alternative 3 ###
- All of the application options are displayed in form of bar which will be on the center of the screen of the mobile.

### Design Alternative 4 ###
- Since diplaying option in a bar isn't that much attractive and user may not be able to find the options quickly so we decided to show them in forms of cube each option have its own cide in front of the screen and all of the features display in front of the user.

### Design Alternative 5 ###
- Moving towards all the final phase all the designs are compiled and we evaluated them personally as well as done by our family members.

### Design Alternative 6 ###
- We uses the concept of Flexiblity because we don't want our design to be complicated so that user can't find their required option that's why we design a simple and easy designs for our application.

# SCENARIO #

### SCENARIO 1  ###
A group of middle school students go on a hike with their local wildlife club. They decide to use WildSnap to keep track of various wildlife and plant life they see. The group leader creates a competition where the top 3 groups with the highest amount of points will win a prize. The groups split up and begin exploring the trails. One group runs across an insect and takes a picture with the app, which determines the insect is a Luna moth caterpillar. At the end of the hike, the group leader looks at the profile pages of each of the groups to see how many points were earned.

### SCENARIO 2  ###
A woman has advanced knowledge about wildlife identification and pursues this interest by tagging and identifying wildlife on weekends. While she is hiking one afternoon, she spots a unique looking animal and opens WildSnap. She is immediately presented with a camera and is able to take a picture before the animal runs off. She saves the picture and later uses the identify option to identify the animal.

### SCENARIO 3  ###
A family has been having an animal infestation problem in their house and would like to know if the animals were poisonous or venomous. No one in the family has any experience with wildlife identification, but the simple design of WildSnap allows them to take pictures and identify animals (insects, snakes, etc.). One evening a small snake is found in the corner of a closet, the father takes a photo from a safe distance, and identifies the snake to be a species that is non-venomous. He is then able to carefully capture and release the snake back outside.
